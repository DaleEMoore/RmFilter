Delete files in a command line specified folder that are older than 1 week.

Hi Mike;

ssh root@mlconsultsrv.com
pushd /var/www/lucycakeshop.com/web
root@g157:/var/www/lucycakeshop.com/web#  ./rmFilter.py  -folder logs

This command line (./rmFilter.py  -folder logs) will just display what files match the filter to be removed. To actually remove the files you have to add the "-rm" option to the command line.

I hope this is helpful,
Dale
