Remove Filter
Delete files according to some filter.

Overview
LucysCakeShop.Com needs it's over 1 week old logs removed.
# Command lines
#   Luter at Lucy's Cake Shop is "./rmFilter.py  -folder logs -rm"
#   Ron at LFI wants to keep EOM, EOQ, EOW and dailys for 10 days.

Using "from argparse import ArgumentParser as ArgumentParser2"
    Not split; used "from argparse import ArgumentParser as ArgumentParser2"

    running unittests in PyCharm gets this:
        usage: utrunner.py [-h] [--folder FOLDER [FOLDER ...]] [-rm] [--keepfriday]
        utrunner.py: error: unrecognized arguments: /home/dalem/PycharmProjects/RmFilter/tests.py true
    and running unit2 has problems with rmFolder's arguments.
    How can I run unit2 and pass arguments down?
    Or should I go back to splitting the code into main.py which does the argparse and rmFilter.py which
    does the actual-processing?

    setup DEV, unit2, unitTest2, PyCharm unittest-ing, TEST, and LIVE
    processing methodologies.

    # It MIGHT be unreasonable to use argparse and unittest2!

    This MIGHT be the answer:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20265522/argparse-and-unittest-python

    use:

        runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
        itersuite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(MyTestClass)
        runner.run(itersuite)

    instead of:

        unittest.main()
    Nope, some other complications. Perhaps it's my dirty code.

    This: http://dustinrcollins.com/testing-python-command-line-apps is an example of something that really works.

    Calling an external command in Python

    Avoid using argparse when running TEST.
        Figure out if I'm running TEST and avoid argparse when in TEST mode.
        Pull the argparse stuff out to be easily avoided so I can still run the key pieces of code
        when in TEST mode. Call the procedures explicitly.
    Key code must be separated from argparse invocation.
    I said this before, but; this is what I should be doing:
        In the middle of spliting main.py into rmFilter.py and main.py;
        and using "from argparse import ArgumentParser as ArgumentParser2".


Create valid unit tests for
    Lucy's Cake Shop
    LFI

Allow run rmFilter in selected folders FLAT, not descending into sub-folders.

Run tests before submitting to git central repository and avoid push if tests fail?

For LFI a smarter remove filter (rmFilter), removing recent files.
    Ron at LFI wants to keep EOM, EOQ, EOW and dailys for 10 days.
    Keep Everyday for the last month.
    Keep Every Friday for the last quarter.
    Keep The first day of every month for the last 2 years.
    rmFilter is a separate project in PycharmProjects.
    https://github.com/DaleEMoore/RmFilter

Add an option to parse file names and folders by a Regular Expression (RE)
    like grep.

Add an option for folder mode scanning only the top-level-folders within the
    target folder and ignoring everything underneath.

Delete files in a command line specified folder that are older than 1 week.

Hi Mike;

ssh root@mlconsultsrv.com
pushd /var/www/lucycakeshop.com/web
root@g157:/var/www/lucycakeshop.com/web#  ./rmFilter.py  -folder logs

This command line (./rmFilter.py  -folder logs) will just display what files match the filter to be removed. To actually remove the files you have to add the "-rm" option to the command line.

I hope this is helpful,
Dale

This seems impossible to me!
At Bubbles.MW the PyCharm version of main.py and the gvim-ed version did not match.
The gvim-ed version was newer.
I copied the gvim version into the PyCharm version.

How am I going to TEST this?
    Build TEST system relying on python testing facilities.
    Learn Python testing, unittest, pytest, ... What's the best/right thing to do?

    I can't build folders and files with appropriate date of creation (Friday, EOM, ...)
    using mkdir on any OS. Instead should I use date of modification?
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/237079/how-to-get-file-creation-modification-date-times-in-python

    Can I have a program mode -SetupTEST which builds
    the TEST data? Can I have a program mode -RunTEST which executes the test
    against TEST data?
    Does the TESTdata folder start in / or \?
    folder TESTdata with some files and
        folder TESTfolder1 Friday with files and folders
        folder TESTfolder2 EOM with files and folders
    run test keepFriday, keepEOM.

    http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/
        Run tests automatically and notify DaleEMoore@gMail.Com of the test results.
        Run all tests before pushing code to the central repository.

    Test runner in PyCharm fails with:
    usage: utrunner.py [-h] [-folder FOLDER [FOLDER ...]] [-rm] [-keepfriday]
    utrunner.py: error: unrecognized arguments: /home/dalem/PycharmProjects/RmFilter/tests.py true

    at main.py line 38
        args = parser.parse_args()

    Somebody has a similar problem here:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24397258/can-not-run-nosetests-when-i-use-argparse-in-my-python-code
    It seems I should split main.py!main() parser code into something that only runs if __name__ == "__main__".
    That code should parse into the same fields that would be setup from test.py!test_rmFilter()
    1) Convert main.py to split parser code into
        if __name__ == "__main__" section
        and save argparse results
    2) Change test.py to create argparse results like item 1, above.
    split parser code so it's not run twice when testing and load fields so main and test get the same results.

Split up code to, perhaps, fix the UnitTest2 problems
    Make main.py a small chunk of code that processes the command line then calls a second routine that
    does the actual-processing. This way I can test the actual-processing without worrying about the interference
    caused by argparse.
    main.py can continue to be the argparse processor.
    What is the name of the new actual-processing file? rmFilter.py?

    Or could I "import argparse as ap2"?
    Or could I "from argparse import ArgumentParser as ap2"?

    "from argparse import ArgumentParser as ap2" seems to be the answer!
    from argparse import ArgumentParser as ArgumentParser2
    Wouldn't it have been better for unitTest2 to do that?
