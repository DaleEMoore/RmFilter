How am I going to TEST this?
    Build TEST system relying on python testing facilities.
    Learn Python testing, unittest, pytest, ... What's the best/right thing to do?

    I can't build folders and files with appropriate date of creation (Friday, EOM, ...)
    using mkdir on any OS. Instead should I use date of modification?
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/237079/how-to-get-file-creation-modification-date-times-in-python

    Can I have a program mode -SetupTEST which builds
    the TEST data? Can I have a program mode -RunTEST which executes the test
    against TEST data?
    Does the TESTdata folder start in / or \?
    folder TESTdata with some files and
        folder TESTfolder1 Friday with files and folders
        folder TESTfolder2 EOM with files and folders
    run test keepFriday, keepEOM.

    http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/
        Run tests automatically and notify DaleEMoore@gMail.Com of the test results.
        Run all tests before pushing code to the central repository.

For LFI a smarter remove filter (rmFilter), removing recent files.
    Ron at LFI wants to keep EOM, EOQ, EOW and dailys for 10 days.
    Keep Everyday for the last month.
    Keep Every Friday for the last quarter.
    Keep The first day of every month for the last 2 years.
    rmFilter is a separate project in PycharmProjects.
    https://github.com/DaleEMoore/RmFilter

Add an option to parse file names and folders by a Regular Expression (RE)
    like grep.

Add an option for folder mode scanning only the top-level-folders within the
    target folder and ignoring everything underneath.

Delete files in a command line specified folder that are older than 1 week.

Hi Mike;

ssh root@mlconsultsrv.com
pushd /var/www/lucycakeshop.com/web
root@g157:/var/www/lucycakeshop.com/web#  ./rmFilter.py  -folder logs

This command line (./rmFilter.py  -folder logs) will just display what files match the filter to be removed. To actually remove the files you have to add the "-rm" option to the command line.

I hope this is helpful,
Dale

This seems impossible to me!
At Bubbles.MW the PyCharm version of main.py and the gvim-ed version did not match.
The gvim-ed version was newer.
I copied the gvim version into the PyCharm version.
